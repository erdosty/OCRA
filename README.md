OCRA: Non-Perfused Choriocapillaris Area Calculator 1.60

With 1.60 edition, the bugs were fixed.

With 1.50 edition, choriocapillary flow voids measured with Phansalkar thresholding, which is the modification of Sauvola's thresholding method to deal with low contrast images.

With 1.45 edition, automatic flow void measurement made with both Gaussian and maximum entropy thresholding.

OCRA is an application for automatic non-perfused choriocapillaris area calculation from OCT-angiography images. OCRA uses en-face OCTA images of the superficial plexus, outer retina en-face, and choriocapillaris structural OCT images of the outer retina to calculate non-perfused choriocapillaris areas. OCRA is using maximum entropy, Gaussian, Phansalkar, and global thresholding methods to threshold different layers of retina, because of different noise characteristics. OCRA exports the results in *.xls and *.jpg formats.
