OCRA: Non-Perfused Choriocapillaris Area Calculator

For Stable Version (OCRA 1.46): https://github.com/erdosty/OCRA/releases/tag/1.46

For Latest Version (OCRA 1.60): https://github.com/erdosty/OCRA/releases/tag/1.60

In 1.46 edition, automatic flow void measurement made with both Gaussian and maximum entropy thresholding.

In 1.60 edition, choriocapillary flow voids measured with Phansalkar thresholding, which is the modification of Sauvola's thresholding method to deal with low contrast images.

OCRA is an application for automatic non-perfused choriocapillaris area calculation from OCT-angiography images. OCRA uses en-face OCTA images of the outer retina en-face OCT, superficial plexus, choriocapillaris, outer retina en-face structural OCT-angiography images of the outer retina to calculate non-perfused choriocapillaris areas. OCRA is using maximum entropy, Gaussian, Phansalkar, and global thresholding methods to threshold different layers of retina, for simulation of different noise characteristics of different retinal layers. OCRA exports the results in *.xls and *.jpg formats.
