Automatic Non-Perfused Choriocapillaris Area Calculator for OCT-Angiography Images

With 1.52 edition, the bugs were fixed.

With 1.50 edition, choriocapillary flow voids measured with Phansalkar thresholding, which is the modification of Sauvola's thresholding method to deal with low contrast images.

With 1.45 edition, automatic flow void measurement made with both gaussian and maximum entropy thresholding.

OCRA is an application for automatic non-perfused choriocapillaris area calculation from OCT-angiography images. OCRA uses en-face OCTA images of the superficial plexus, outer retina, and choriocapillaris, and en-face structural OCT images of the outer retina to calculate non-perfused choriocapillaris area. OCRA also exports the results in *.xls and *.jpg formats.
